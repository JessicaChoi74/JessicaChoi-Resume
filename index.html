        <p class="lead mb-4">Being a Korean American female, it has been a struggle with keeping up with the social standards. We always need to be put together and very ‚Äúgirly‚Äù. Being at school, I had to keep the image of a quiet and nice girl. This allowed me to serve in a lot of community services during my high school year which was one of the only pros. Thankfully, my parents weren‚Äôt strict as other parents but they still had this stigma in the back of their heads. It has been a blessing being able to grow up in a loving family and have so many privileges of growing up in a middle class neighborhood. Being in ROTC during my years in high school, it has made me realize how efficient a person can be. I also realized how tedious it is. Especially for the uniforms. It had taught me how I can put up my hair in a neat slick back bun and iron my clothes to look clean and crisp.
<br><br>

        I volunteered at my church every sunday to babysit 1-3 year olds while their parents were in service worshipping the Lord. This made me realize that watching babies wasn't easy but it also opened my eyes that I had a passion with children. At that moment, I saw myself teaching in the future and knew how much I loved children. They were so bubbly and positive. It was so healing to see all of them playing together. The one song I thought was perfect was God you‚Äôre so Good by Passion. The lyrics are ‚ÄúAmazing love That welcomes me, the kindness of mercy That bought with blood, wholeheartedly My soul undeserving God, You're so good Oh God, You're so good God, You're so good You're so good to me Behold the cross Age to age And hour by hour The dead are raised, the sinner saved The work of Your power God, You're so good God, You're so good God, You're so good You're so good to me‚Äù. This song really allowed me to more so pour my love to the children and have grace just like Jesus did for us.
<br><br>

        We were fortunate to have a warm home in the winter and a cool home in the summer. We didn‚Äôt need to worry about what would happen if we didn‚Äôt have enough to pay the water, gas, and or the electric bill. We were very blessed to live this comfortable life and it allowed us to be thankful. In this time, one song that helped me keep myself humble was Brokenness Aside by All Sons and Daughters. The lyrics were so heart touching and they say ‚ÄúWill your grace run out If I let you down. 'Cause all I know Is how to run. 'Cause I am a sinner If it's not one thing it's another. Caught up in words Tangled in lies: But You are a Savior And You take brokenness aside and make it beautiful Beautiful.‚Äù After hearing these lyrics it made me really take time and think about how blessed and fortunate my situation is, of course this was before covid hit.
